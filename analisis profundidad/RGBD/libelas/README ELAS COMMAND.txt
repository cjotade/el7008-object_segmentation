In order to run the disparity map calculus just do:

./elas example/images_pgm/left/ example/images_pgm/right/ example/images_disp/ example/images_pgm/img_info_LR.txt


1st arg: path where are the left images in pgm
2nd arg: path where are the right images in pgm
3rd arg: path to save disparity images
4th arg: path where is the images information to find the correspondence between left and right
